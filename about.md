Welcome to hair's lair. This is where I post stuff about game design and the projects I'm working on.

hairmachine is an old username I've had since the dawn of the internet. It came from an old school joke, unsurprisingly
involving hair.

My IRL name is Simon Williams, and I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur based in London. Apart from games, building stuff,
tinkering and thinking, I like choral singing, playing piano and reading a lot.
