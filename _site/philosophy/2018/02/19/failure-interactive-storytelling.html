    <p>I think it’s uncontroversial to say stories are ingrained in our psyches. As animals time is one of our fundamental experiences, 
and the organisation of events into narratives of cause and effect is extremely important in our understanding of the world. 
Consequently stories have an innate attraction to us; stories allow us to imagine and experience new worlds, to challenge 
our ideas and feelings, and to gain new understanding of our lives.</p>

<p>The idea of interactive storytelling is old, and the most pop-culture friendly examples are the entertainment programs of 
Star Trek’s holodeck. These appear to be taken as the ultimate end points of games; true works of art of full emotional 
breadth, in which you can act and react and participate within the story, which moulds itself around your actions and is 
able to create novel and exciting situations. Many, many designers have this goal in mind and attempt to achieve it, 
particularly RPG designers who focus on choice, consequence and reactivity. The link between the RPG and interactive 
storytelling is clearly strong; pen and paper RPGs use a human game master to handle their players, allowing for extremely 
rich gameplay (dependent on the skill of the game master). Can we do something approaching this with video games?</p>

<p>The major stumbling block here is that interactive storytelling is a brutally hard problem. Most tackle it with a branching 
tree structure, but it’s easy to see these are very limited in their responsiveness and flexibility. They are almost as 
un-interactive as turning a page in a book, and indeed page-turning is how classic tree based interactive stories such 
as Fighting Fantasy or Choose Your Own Adventure functioned. Those who have tried to go further often run into serious 
problems.</p>

<p>Chris Crawford, a veteran game designer probably most notable for “Balance of Power”, an extremely detailed simulation of 
cold-war geopolitics, has recently abandoned his attempt to solve these problems after a series of failures to produce 
working games. His work hinges around the design of autonomous AI agents which act by following personality inclinations 
and a verb-based human-computer interaction pattern, but the emergent complexity of the resultant system is enormous and 
it becomes borderline impossible to produce bug-free or enjoyable gameplay. In addition despite the complexity it also 
suffers from repetitiveness and uncanny valley issues, and the stripped-back language used to communicate between the 
player and computer is dry and technical, completely lacking dramatic flair.</p>

<p>Another major attempt, Versu by Emily Short and Richard Evans, works on a different system - AI agents backed up by human 
writing and scene structuring. AI agents interact with each other and the player, and based on their inclinations cause 
certain scenes in the story to play out or not, as well as being provided with default responses and interactions to the 
unfolding events in the case where they are called on to behave in unanticipated ways. This creates a far richer palette 
than standard tree-based structures, and does not fall prey as badly to the explosive complexity of Crawford’s approach 
(whilst being less ambitious in scope). The main issue with Versu is in the dichotomy between its AI agents and what the 
author has provided. In the example game, Blood and Honour, it is very easy to produce strange effects from the AI, such 
as getting them to flirt with you while their partners look benignly on; the poor partner, constrained by what the author 
has imagined for their reactions, can only sit mute before spouting their next plot point. This can result in some truly 
hilarious absurdities. Versu, though a strong system with great potential, ultimately lost its funding after the release 
of one game.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, though true interactive storytelling is a way off, there is much to be improved about the interactivity 
of stories. In particular, a relatively simple system and tools for constructing complex non-tree based narrative structures, 
which are controllable with logic and have access to underlying game state, does not exist in a portable form. Such a system 
would work by allowing human-curated narrative structure to be tied to arbitrarily complex game states, allowing designers 
more control over how they present story material.</p>

<p>This approach, while not really true interactive storytelling, but has seen some initial success in games such as “Facade” 
and “80 days”, where a bewildering array of possibilities branch from subtle changes in underlying state, creating something 
that feels much more explorable and less easily exploitable than node based trees. Many RPGs use a similar system; 
“Planescape Torment” is often held up as a prime example of a rich, branching narrative within this framework.</p>

<p>On the whole though, stories in games are basically linear, largely unreactive, and mostly follow simple tree structures; 
the stories are uninteractive, leaving the interactivity to be handled by other mechanics. Crawford has called this 
‘kinotropic storytelling’; by quickly switching between static story and interactive gameplay, the designer hopes to give 
the impression of an interactive story. Like the kinotrope, this is illusory.</p>

<p>While true interactive storytelling is probably not completely possible, there is still a lot of scope to make the integration
of story and game more dynamic and interesting.</p>
